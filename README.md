## Contributing

Export your edited deck with Anki as an `.apkg` file, use `anki_to_git.py` from the above repo, and push changes.

**Note**: When exporting the edited deck, make sure to uncheck "Include scheduling information" as (obviously) other people are at different progress levels on these cards!
